Hydrogen is a reagent used in many industrial sectors, including chemicals, textile fiber manufacturing, glass, electronics and metallurgy. It is also used as fuel for rocket launchers.the result of Sodium and water reaction is 2Na(s) + 2H2O → 2NaOH(aq) + H2(g). .Magnesium reacts with steam or hot water.the result of Magnesium and steam is Mg(s) + 2H2O(g) → Mg(OH)2(aq) + H2(g).The result of Calcium and steam is Ca (s) + 2H2O (g) -> Ca(OH)2 (aq) + H2 (g).
